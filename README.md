## What is Board? ##
The Board module for Moodle is a plugin that enables a post-it board activity for students.
This is a collaborative activity where the teachers sets out a number of columns with
optional names and then students add contributions to a column. Students do not see who has
posted what.

On the Board, Students can:
* Add a new post with some of the following:
  * A heading.
  * Some text.
  * Add A link.
  * Upload an image.
  * Embed a Youtube video.
* Edit or Delete one of their posts.

They can also do the following depending on the settings of the teacher:
* Move their notes among columns.
* Star someone elses post.

The teacher can set up the activity with the following options:
* A closing date for submissions.
* How the posts are ordered in a column, by date or star count.
* Whether posts can be starred - by students, teachers, or neither.

On the board a teacher can:
* Move any of the posts from one column to another.
* Download a copy of the board contents.
* Download a spreadsheet of submissions of the students.
